                <p>Courtney:  Mitch, let’s talk about the backdrop for investing in small caps right now.  We have a strong dollar, weak oil, they, you know, created last year, GDP growth has been kind of anemic, economic data so so, and interest rates.  The world is kind of captive to when The Fed is going to raise them, how do you characterize the opportunity set right now?</p>
                <p>Mitch Begun:  [00:00:18] That’s a good question.  I think we’re still very optimistic about small cap stocks in general.  I think one important aspect of that is interest rates and the trends that we’ll see in interest rates.  You know, we looked back at prior performance given changes in the interest rates.  And what you’ve found over the last sort of 12 tightening cycles, and we’re upon one soon, there has been a mix of slow and fast tightening cycles, meaning fast, meaning consecutive rate increases, meeting to meeting.  When you look at that that’s about 7 of the 12 in the post war era, the other 5 which I would characterize as slower tend to be much more favorable for equities and in particular small caps.  And so the question arises is what do you believe that the interest rate cycle may look like over the coming period?  And therefore that can help determine the outcome of returns.  We’re in the camp that we would expect a slower rise in rates.  That has not happened as much frequently, in the last few cycles.  But given the clarity, given the lack of growth generally speaking and lower inflation I think that is a more probable event.  So I do think it presents a tailwind for equities going forward and looking out 12/24 months.  And so we’re optimistic as it relates to that specifically.</p>
                <p>Courtney:  [00:01:55] So it looks a little like it probably will be in one of the slower which history shows us is a positive, is a tailwind for equities?</p>
                <p>Mitch Begun:  [00:02:01] Absolutely.</p>
                <div class="paraTruc_hide"><div class="paraTruc_content" style="display: none;"><p>Courtney:  [00:02:02] Okay, great.</p><p>Jack McPherson:  [00:02:03] Yeah.  And I think that the current economic backdrop is supportive of small caps continuing to outperform the economic growth.  Maybe isn’t as great as most people would like but it’s sufficient enough for companies to continue to earn nice profits.  And as Mitch said, with interest rates projected to go up more slowly, more likely, they could just … it gives investors time to adjust to a rising rate environment.</p><p>Courtney:  [00:02:30] Yeah.  We’ve been hearing so long, you know, we thought The Fed was going to have a June liftoff and now it looks … now they’ve said they’re data dependent, it looks like we might not be able to meet that hurdle for June or even July, to your point.</p><p>Jack McPherson:  [00:02:42] Right.  And presumably one of the reasons for raising interest rates going forward is because the economy is doing well.  And if the economy’s doing well then that’s a favorable backdrop for corporate profitability.</p><p>Bill Hench:  [00:02:53] I would agree, I think, you know, we’ll probably spend the rest of this year, we’re almost halfway through, adjusting to the fact that rates are going up.  But we have a really good diet of things to look at, right.  You’ve got employment improving, even when rates go up, they’ll still be low.  Europe’s probably bottomed.  And if you’re a small cap investor, you’re dealing predominantly with stocks that generate most of their revenue and income in North America.  So we should be pretty good.  The rest of the year could be a little slugfest though.</p><p>Courtney:  [00:03:24] Yeah.  So that’s an interesting point though about the dollar that, you know, the large multinationals are not having quite as an easier time as the small caps would because they’re so dependent on exports.  So that should be a tailwind as well.</p><p>Bill Hench:  [00:03:36] Yeah.  And you know, the large caps continue to have all the momentum right now, you know, intuitively we think that with the dollar situation and with the stronger US growth that you’d be looking at our stocks saying, “Well, how long can you keep this up?”  But it has not been the case.</p><p>Gregory Halter:  [00:03:51] And just to expand on that, just yesterday the housing data came out and that was very strong, strongest in, I don’t know, seven or eight years or something like that.  So, obviously those numbers bounce around from quarter to quarter, but that nice backdrop as well with plenty of small companies in that space.  Additionally I would say that the small companies have lots of cash on their balance sheets, which is a positive if rates do go up, they can actually earn something on that cash instead of the .1% or whatever they’re getting currently.  So that would be a positive as well.</p><p>Courtney:  [00:04:21] Absolutely.  And to your point, Bill, you know, we’ve seen kind of less growth than we would have hoped in the first and second quarters.  Do you think the second half of the year is going to show better things to come?</p><p>Bill Hench:  [00:04:33] I do, and specifically if you look to the last quarter, you know, a lot of the poor number was the result of, you know, the dollar.  You know, we’re not going to probably have another 25% move in the dollar.  And if you look at everything that happened in the oil and gas sector, that accounted for a lot of the weakness as well.  So as we go forward, as you continue to see better employment and commodity prices that are doing nothing but helping the US, we should be in pretty good shape.</p><p>Courtney:  [00:04:59] Yeah.</p><p>Jack McPherson:  [00:05:00] I think one of the issues that investors are going to have to understand though is that we saw the expectations for returns, you know, obviously since the market bottomed in 09, small caps in the market in general have compounded at well above normal rates of return.  And so we’re more likely to see more normalized returns going forward, whatever normal might be, but you know, if investors are expecting, you know, high double digit type returns again, it’s probably unlikely.  It’s more probably going to be somewhere in the high single digit to low double digits on a compounded basis over the next few years.</p><p>Courtney:  [00:05:34] So a resetting of expectations.</p><p>Jack McPherson:  [00:05:36] Right.</p><p>Mitch Begun:  [00:05:37] Yeah.  I’d add a comment to that, I think if you take a little bit of a longer term perspective and you look at even the last 10 years, you almost see no differentiation between the Russell 2000 and the Russell 1000.  So the small cap proxy versus the large cap proxy.  Last year was an anomaly where large caps really outperformed.  We’ve now seen on a trailing 12 month basis, almost equal performance in the 2000 and 1000.  So my sense is that when you look at long histories and on an absolute return basis, not necessarily a risk adjusted return basis, small caps do outperform.  And so this period of call it, relatively okay performance for small caps, I think in BD bonds and small caps can outperform from here given history and some of the dynamics that we’re talking about today.</p><p>Courtney:  [00:06:36] Absolutely, especially with a rising rate environment like you said, historically if it’s in a slow cycle that should happen.</p><p>Mitch Begun:  [00:06:42] And certainly it’s slow, yes.</p><p>Courtney:  [00:06:44] And we actually have a … yeah, right.  And we actually have a chart showing the S&amp;P 500 versus the S&amp;P small cap 600.  You can see the outperformance over the past 2009 through 2015 period.  You know, what does that tell you?  Is that a surprise, I know you’ve mentioned…</p><p>Mitch Begun:  [00:07:03] Well, I think it supports his point.  I think when you go back farther and you look at longer term returns they have equated roughly, not on a risk adjusted basis but on an absolute basis.  And so that’s where I’d come back to, small cap companies typically grow faster, the market pays more for that.  And because the return profile of the … if you take the Russell 2000 and 1000, there’s almost no differentiation.  It gives me optimism that that can continue.</p><p>Jack McPherson:  [00:07:36] Yeah, I think again, it just goes back to, if you look at the start of this chart, going back to 2009, you have to look at what preceded it, and what preceded it was a pretty dramatic drop from mid 07 through March of 2009.  And so hopefully that isn’t going to be repeated, we won’t see another drop of that magnitude.  So if that, you know, what’s driven the market the last five plus years has been a recovery off the bottom, it’s been, you know, obviously a growth coming out of an economic recession and in the subsequent revenue growth, margin expansion and multiple expansion within the market.  So a lot of what’s driven the market in the last five years is unlikely to repeat going forward.  So it really comes back to at this point making sure that you understand what the risk parameters are for the market overall as well as the individual companies in your portfolio.</p><p>Courtney:  [00:08:21] Yeah.  Well, that’s a really interesting point.  Do you feel though that the small caps are more insulated from a risk perspective than say their large cap or mid cap peers in these macro headwinds?</p><p>Jack McPherson:  [00:08:32] No, I don’t think they’re necessarily insulated but I think it comes back to the point, you know, the US, while the economy may not be doing as well as we would like, I think is doing better than most economies around the world.  So it’s, you know, the overused term, it’s a bit of a safe haven.  So I think in with 80% of revenues from small caps derived from domestic sources approximately, it just provides a decent backdrop for companies to continue to perform.  The wild card will be what is the investor appetite for risk?  And that can be impacted by a lot of things, the pace of interest rate increases.  It can be impacted by geopolitical events, and just an overall perception of risk around the world.  So obviously there’s no guarantees going forward but the backdrop is favorable and so long as we don’t have a dramatic change in interest rates, we don’t have an exogenous shock to the system then I think it does set up pretty well.</p><p>Courtney:  [00:09:27] Okay.  So set up pretty well unless we see a steep rise in interest rates, which seems to be unlikely at this point or some black spot in that.<br>
                            Jack McPherson:  [00:09:33] And with that reset of expectations it will probably not be going up at 20/25% rate like we did, you know, at the beginning part of the recovery.<br>
                            Courtney:  [00:09:42] Okay.  So, again about resetting expectations.</p><p>Jack McPherson:  [00:09:44] Right.</p><p>Courtney:  [00:09:44] Bill, you had a point?</p><p>Bill Hench:  [00:09:45] You know, as long as you get paid for the risk, it’s fine.  And if you look at what’s been happening, you know, take the small cap market in the last 18 months, right, you know, had you not been in biotech, REITs and utilities you’re really flat to down.  So you would think that in a market that has seen improvements in housing, you pointed out, and employment, costs, you know, everybody said, “Oh, margins can’t get any better.”  But the point of fact, when you take oil and gas and copper and aluminum and everything else you put into production and you cut those prices dramatically, you have margin improvements as well to look forward to.  So you can build a pretty good case for a really strong 16 and 17, not just a sort of bounce back.</p><p>Courtney:  [00:10:32] Absolutely, yeah, like to your point, the depression and the commodity complex and the energy complex, you know, while people just look at that as an absolute, it’s really helped a lot of the small cap companies and markets.</p><p>Bill Hench:  [00:10:41] I mean this is a, you know, we still live in a country where like 70% of our economy is consumer based.  And most families live on $50,000/55,000 a year less; you cut energy prices, that’s a material change in your monthly outlook.</p><p>Courtney:  [00:10:55] Absolutely.  And it’s money in the consumers’ pocket.</p><p>Bill Hench:  [00:10:59] Right.</p><p>Gregory Halter:  [00:11:01] I would add in on the chart going from 09 is generally we’re looking for companies, small cap companies that are protagonists with managements who are protagonists in their industry, where a small company can be much more nimble than a large company.  And what we’ve seen I think is … we don’t have to mention any names, but we know who they are, the larger names who are doing financial engineering through share repurchase and spinning off companies, is that really running the business?  Maybe, maybe not, it’s helping the stock price.  But then you look at the small companies and you see them, they can be nimble, they can be creative, they can spend on R&amp;D and come out of recession like a lot of companies did in 09 and improve their business position, improve their margins so that they have margins that are higher than they were the prior peak.  So we’ve certainly seen that.  We seek those companies out, obviously not easy to find them.  But we do look for them and occasionally find a few.</p><p>Courtney:  [00:11:55] Absolutely, yeah.  Well, I want to go to a view … I’m sorry, go ahead.</p><p>Mitch Begun:  [00:11:58] Yeah.  I think I want to add one thing about this because when we talk about this chart, because of the nature of the indices where you have growth and value tilts.  To me the more fascinating thing that’s gone on over this period is that the Russell 2000 growth has drastically outperformed the Russell 2000 value for 10 years, it’s 250 basis points plus annualized, it’s staggering.  And I know when I started in this industry and many of you, value outperformed for a long time.  And so the paradigm has flipped, and I think what’s happened and I think most of us here would agree, because we’ve been in a slower economic growth environment the market tends to pay up for that scarcity of growth.  And to me that has become and it probably explains some of the differentials in the indices and just how much growth value tilt, you eluded to not owning biotech, I mean that’s a perfect example of many managers that avoided that, that’s been a big differentiator in performance.</p><p>Courtney:  [00:13:02] Absolutely.  And in a rising rate environment though, do you think that will continue?</p><p>Mitch Begun:  [00:13:09] I think there is going to be good and bad sectors.  I think where there is froth in the market, rising rates can put pressure and so to the extent there is froth in biotech per se, I think that will put pressure.  But there will be very attractive industries such as financials that can benefit from that.  I think rising rate environments will be detrimental to sort of the bond proxy industries, utilities, REITs, and so again it goes back to the pace of that change, and I think a slower pace can be managed across the … particularly in the small cap universe.</p><p>Courtney:  [00:13:43] Yeah, yeah.  I mean especially there, you’re right, interest rate sensitivity in the REITs and utilities kind of on the downside.  But then on the upside financials with the increase in that interest margin, and we’re going to get into sectors later, which is another great topic.  I want to go quickly to our viewer question; it’s from Carter Mansbach of Jupiter Wealth Strategies and Jupiter Florida.</p><p>Carter Mansbach:  [00:14:12] Assuming that we are in a rising rate environment over the next 12-18 months, historically how does that bode for small cap stocks?  Also I’d like to know how the panel thinks small caps will perform in a rising rate environment.</p><p>Courtney:  [00:14:30] Okay, Greg, do you want to take that?</p><p>Gregory Halter:  [00:14:31] Well, I think we’ve passed on it a little bit, I mean Mitch had a lot of background material there and certainly depends on the pace of the rise of rates, you know, and the reality the rates probably should be higher than they are currently as The Fed keeps them potentially artificially low, I think everyone would agree that that has been the case.  But when we’re looking at returns it’s always compared to what?  You know, if your 10 year treasury is 2.25% and you know, you’re getting a stock that … with growth potential that’s yielding 2½%, that might be a much better place to look for something and maybe that stock would still continue to do well because they may have growth behind it as well in terms of the stock performance relative to that 10 year treasury.</p><p>Courtney:  [00:15:15] Right, right, it’s all relative to the opportunity set.</p><p>Gregory Halter:  [00:15:18] Correct.</p><p>Bill Hench:  [00:15:18] So what does it mean for small cap companies, right?  If you’re running a small cap company, usually you’re borrowing money, usually borrowing money from banks, you don’t go to the markets and raise bond money on a Tuesday night like the big companies do.  So you’re borrowing money.  If you’re borrowing money because you’re expanding and you’re doing more business you have to pay more for that money, and it should be okay if you’re doing more business, you should make that up on your margin, right.  If your business is that much stronger it should be okay.  It doesn’t mean the stocks are going to go up right away, and in point of fact they’ll probably go down, right, and you’ll be scared and you’ll pick up the newspaper and say, “My goodness, rates are going up, what do I do?  What do I do?”  And you’ll get over that, which is why I say, 16/17 probably look pretty good because once you get through that you should be in good shape.</p><p>Courtney:  [00:15:58] Yeah.  And even if rates rise they’re still on a relative basis very well for borrowers.</p><p>Jack McPherson:  [00:16:03] Right.  And in a rising rate environment it may change the composition in what drives the market as well, because again a rising rate environment raises the cost of capital for a variety of different industries.  And so a lot of these growth industries that need capital to grow, they’ll be facing a higher cost of capital which will, you know, for some companies will impact their profitability or their profit growth.  So the composition of what drives a market will change in this rising rate environment.  And they will get a reversal of that Russell value versus Russell growth, which is right; the long term clearly shows that values outperform growth over the long term.  And in the recent past there’s been an aberration partly fuelled by the abnormally low interest rates that The Fed has created.</p><p>Courtney:  [00:16:44] So you think we could see a reversal once The Fed raises rates?</p><p>Jack McPherson:  [00:16:48] Between the growth and the value segments of the market, absolutely.</p><p>Mitch Begun:  [00:16:52] Yeah.  I think expanding on that point, it’s … to me it’s the slope of the yield curve probably matters more as it relates to the small to large trade as the question asked, I think as we get a flatter curve, if you will, large caps tend to outperform small caps.  And that’s typically a sign of later in the cycle closer to a recession.  And so I think all these points are very valid and that’s an important point to make though as it relates to large to small.</p><p>Courtney:  [00:17:23] That’s a great point of putting into context of where we are in the cycle too.  And I want to pivot a little bit and talk about performance drivers.  Greg, what was your sense of what really drove performance in small caps over the past 12-18 months?</p><p>Gregory Halter:  [00:17:36] I guess I would say rather than referring to the whole small caps, you know, the way we look at things are is company specific.  So again we’re trying to find the best companies we can to fit within the mould of what we look for within our portfolios.  Again it’s really a company specific bottom up, lots of digging in the trenches and doing work and reading and visiting places that a lot of people don’t go to.  So I think hopefully that’s the case for our portfolios is that we’re finding these companies, discovering these companies which don’t have much coverage on Wall Street and so forth, trying to root them out and you know, hopefully they appreciate because of more exposure to more investors.  Again, that underfollowed, under-owned name, if those companies can continue to perform and put up good numbers, expand their margins, return money to shareholders, either through the form of dividends or share repurchase, ultimately, hopefully the stock price is increased and the shareholder is rewarded.  And hopefully that means that the small caps will outperform or you know, lead to outperformance in the future as they may have in the past.</p><p>Courtney:  [00:18:51] Yeah.  And absolutely, and going back to your process, I mean just the nature of small caps, it allows, you know, for more access to management, more access to CEOs and being able to really kick the tires in a way that you know, is less easy to do with a large cap.  And maybe because there’s less you know, there’s so much more information from the sale side with the larger caps it’s really an opportunity if you have the skill set to identify those companies, like the ones you just mentioned.</p><p>Gregory Halter:  [00:19:22] Right.  There’s lots of information out there, it’s just a matter of whether or not you’re willing to go seek it out there and find it.</p><p>Courtney:  [00:19:28] Right.  What was your sense?</p><p>Jack McPherson:  [00:19:31] No, I mean I think, you know, what’s driven the market the last 18 months or so has really been that willingness to take risk at a certain level.  And we all know biotechnology’s been a big driver of the small cap segment.  You know, it’s up several 100% over the past few years.  Part of that is because of the availability cap [inaudible] raise equity and it’s been a big headwind for a lot of active managers out there.  You’ve also seen, you know, in the chase for yield, REITs perform very well and REIT yields and cap rates going to levels that suggest they’re richly valued.  Utilities did have a real strong last year.  So those are the kind of things that have been driving the market.  And as we were saying earlier, if interest rates do start to rise and go at a modest pace as we’ve said, then I think that that’s one of the things that really could change the tenor of the market.  And so you know, I think investors just need to be aware of the risk of chasing what has been working, the Russell, you know, the Russell growth, what’s been, you know, chasing the biotechnology or other areas doesn’t mean that they’re going to collapse and they’re going to fall out of bed.  But if they stop going up at the pace they have been going up, I think that, again, changes the tenor of the market.</p><p>Courtney:  [00:20:46] And do you think … you mentioned the risk before, peoples’ expanded appetite for risk, do you think that was largely driven by a lack of yield or chasing yield?</p><p>Jack McPherson:  [00:20:54] I think that is part of it.  I think that you know, with yields [inaudible] investments being where they are, investors are really, really struggling to try to get some kind of income and so you’ve seen, you know, yield oriented securities really perform well.  And that’s fine.  But can you continue to grow the dividend at the rate you were?  And if all of a sudden the competition for those yield oriented investors change, because [inaudible] rates are going up then it would be natural to see someone [inaudible].  Again, it doesn’t mean that you need to call for a bear market in yield oriented investments but if they just stop going up at the pace they’ve been going up, then again it changes the market environment.</p><p>Courtney:  [00:21:34] So a little bit of a change especially with REITs and utilities?</p><p>Jack McPherson:  [00:21:37] Right.</p><p>Courtney:  [00:21:37] Okay.</p><p>Mitch Begun:  [00:21:38] Yeah, I think I’d take a little bit of a different take on that.  I agree that healthcare has been the predominant driver, if you look at the 2000 growth to the 2000 value, it’s actually fairly staggering.  And so the managers that weren’t playing in that suffer, those that were, benefit on an active basis.  I do believe in the very short term as rates rise there’s some risk to healthcare in that sense.  Having said that I do think there’s been a very good secular backdrop.  And there are good reasons to why healthcare has worked and in particular, biotech.  These companies have understood some populations of diseases and how to treat them better, the FDA getting drugs through the system are better.  And so to me, I guess, in maybe summing it up, I would say if you come up with a new drug or a new technology in whatever field it may be, as disruptive as it is, interest rates aren’t going to matter, and maybe in the short term have corrections in valuation, but if you’re truly coming up with something that’s disruptive, I mean that’s really our focus as investors, as growth investors.  And so these are, to me, a little bit more short term focused versus what we’re trying to do with risk capture and find large disruptive companies.</p><p>Courtney:  [00:23:03] Absolutely, that’s such a big trend, Greg?</p><p>Gregory Halter:  [00:23:06] I’d like to jump in there on the biotech side.  If you look at the large companies, the pharma companies, they had layoffs years ago, a lot of those people which were very well qualified people either started up or went to work for small companies, small caps.  And they were allowed to spend money and use the R&amp;D budget which they weren’t really allowed to do at the larger companies.  So now we have these small companies that are being gobbled up again by the larger companies.  It’s a process that you’ll see over and over and over again, not just in biotech, but in many different fields.  And I think that’s what creates markets and makes markets, it’s quite interesting.</p><p>Courtney:  [00:23:43] Absolutely.  I mean like that brings up a great point, have we seen a big increase in M&amp;A activity in small caps?</p><p>Bill Hench:  [00:23:48] No.  If you look at last year, 70% of the deals were private equity to private equity.  And the vast majority of the rest were big companies buying other big companies.  So you know, when I worked at [inaudible], you know, after a big cycle you’d say, “Alright, it’s time to clean up the mess.”  And cleaning up the mess simply was all the companies that had come public, that maybe shouldn’t be independent.  And maybe they had more of a product than a company or maybe they just didn’t have the financing that emerged, they’d be bought; two things come together, created something bigger.  We didn’t see that this cycle.  Can you see it now?  Sure.  Is there any reason not to, when he brought up the fact that the balance sheets are in such good shape, you know, it’s not just Apple and the other big companies that have these tremendous amounts of cash.  If you looked through all sectors, you’ll see that since 08 everybody’s gotten religion and everybody keeps a little more cash than they used to, right.  And you see that across the board in our company.  So typical industries that went through these very, very difficult [inaudible] times when their cycle was out of favor and say, “My goodness, they’re going to make it.”  You don’t see that anymore, right, because everybody has a little bit more cushion than they used to.</p><p>Gregory Halter:  [00:24:55] We just attended a home builders’ conference yesterday in fact here in New York and it’s amazing that all of the home builder managements are talking about how good their balance sheets are.  Obviously we didn’t see that in 06, 07, 08.  But they’ve gotten the religion that you talked about and that’s a major change in the perspective of these managements.</p><p>Courtney:  [00:25:15] That is a huge change.  And, Bill, I want to ask you about micro caps, what are you seeing there?</p><p>Bill Hench:  [00:25:19] Lots of value, okay, and there’s lots of things that have been ignored.  You know, I would suspect if you sort of broke the Russell 2000 or even the S&amp;P 600 up and you stratified it, the lower you get the worst the performance has been, so very much inverse to what happened last time, small caps really did well.  I don’t know if it’s ETFs not playing in that end of the pool or not or whether it’s just a fear of growth or interest rates or availability to capital.  But that’s where the values are.  So if you look below that billion and half a billion dollars, there are a lot of things that represent good value, have good growth, all the nice little things you want to do when you’re making your checklist of what I want to buy, what I don’t want to buy.  And sooner it’ll work right now, no one cares, you know, one day they’re up, the next day they’re down.  Liquidity is always an issue, you know, you’re always going … some little liquidity will stink and it does.  And when things get ugly it gets really, really bad, right.</p><p>Courtney:  [00:26:16] So tell me is this largely related to the regulations that came out in 08, the Dodd Frank and the Volcker Rule that the market makers are no longer the market makers in some of these especially thinly traded stocks?</p><p>Bill Hench:  [00:26:26] I don’t think so, I mean it’s … it always comes down to whether or not people are interested in the sector or not.  Do they see the ability to make money?  Can you really get paid for that risk?  And with growth overall being what it is, which is not exciting people, and with rates looking like they’re going up, there’s a natural temptation for people to think that these are the riskier assets.  I mean when, you know, quite frankly they’re not, you know, if you look at their book value, if you look at their price to sales, their margins, the whole … if you look at the whole picture on a micro cap market you can build a case that you’d want to be there much rather than sort of in the bigger jumbo shrimp I guess, whatever you want to call them.  Because that’s, you know, they get much, much less coverage than even the smaller caps, right.  But when they want them and you become the market maker it’s a very, very good feeling when they start passing that out.</p><p>Courtney:  [00:27:15] I’m sure.  I’m sure.</p><p>Gregory Halter:  [00:27:16] I would take a little different slant on that from the standpoint that we actually, the PMs do the trading as well.  And trying to buy stocks these days can be difficult when it’s 100 x 100 shares and you’re trying to buy 25,000 share of something in a day.  And you see it trading 125,000 shares in a day and you buy 10, it’s just amazing, it almost seems like the broker on the other side has to find the right dark pool or whatever to get into, to get that liquidity and that volume.  So it’s really become a strange market.  And I don’t think the common person out there understands because they can use [inaudible] trade and buy 10,000 shares easily.  But the professionals, we can’t, it’s kind of really gotten strange.</p><p>Courtney:  [00:28:00] Yeah, the scenario you just suggested, I mean buying 8% of a daily volume of a stock is enormous.  So that’s an interesting point, are you guys seeing that as well?</p><p>Mitch Begun:  [00:28:11] I think we see it in the very small cap names.  But we’ve got parameters and risk parameters such that we try to avoid very illiquid stocks, such that we want to be able to trade them within about two weeks at full capacity.  So we have been very conservative about that and trying to build a business that is long lasting in nature.  So it’s not something that we run into as much as maybe a micro cap manager otherwise would.</p><p>Jack McPherson:  [00:28:42] Yeah.  I mean I think, you know, trading liquidity has always been an issue in the small and micro cap segment of the market.  You know, we focus more on the liquid side, just from a risk control perspective; we’re trying to make sure we can build a position and exit a position if we need to.  So you know, it’s never easy, but I don’t think it’s a constraint on building a nice portfolio.  And I don’t think it’s a constraint on generating good returns.  If you’re focused on micro cap, you just, you learn how to deal with it.  And so again, I just don’t, I don’t see that as an issue.  But you know, what’s the root cause of it?  I’m not exactly sure.  But I think the markets are changing, you mentioned the rise of the ETFs before, that’s clearly having an impact, you know, on those segments that where there are ETFs and then the dark pools, you have algorithmic trading and everything else in between.  So you know the nature of the market has just changed.  But you deal with it, you identify good companies that can create value, buying them at the right price and if you hold for a long period of time you can still make money.  So trading liquidity shouldn’t be an issue for long term investors.</p><p>Courtney:  [00:29:46] Okay.  And I think that ETF point that you made, Bill, is fascinating.  You know, we’ve seen enormous inflows into ETFs and to think, yeah, maybe they didn’t touch the micro.  So that is fascinating.  And you also mentioned valuations.  I want to get your guys’ take on what you’re seeing now in terms of valuations?</p><p>Mitch Begun:  [00:30:06] Yeah.  So when you look at, you know, our focus is very much bottom up stock by stock.  So when we talk about valuation it tends to be a function of the types of names that are being brought into the portfolio from the fundamental research the team’s doing from a bottom up.  And so as a result what happens is, when I talk about valuation where we’re finding more ideas is effectively what’s happening.  The caveat being that what we’ve found over time is that when you look at the interest sector correlations of each sector, they tend to be lower in consumer and tech and healthcare.  And what that means is that these companies tend to control their own fate, they tend to be a little less cyclical, they tend to be able to differentiate themselves say versus energy which tends to be highly correlated to the price of the commodity, or similar industrials to the price of global demand or the trends in global demand.  We are finding significant value in the technology space today.  I think healthcare has extended itself in valuations that are a little bit more concerning, but technology is an area that we are finding a lot of opportunities.  And I’ll come back to that briefly.  But financials as well, as we talk about interest rates, it’s an area that most growth managers don’t own a lot of.  We think regional banks are very attractive and we’re seeing good growth rates there and can benefit from higher rates.  And on the flipside of that the REITs and the utilities are less attractive.<br>
                            And to wrap up that, in technology one of the things … and I spent this week at JP Morgan’s technology conference, and there’s all sorts of talk about cloud, mobility, analytics, social media.  And one of the things that I think is often not talked about are really the people that are helping develop that, and so we own a number of names in the IT services space that are building software and infrastructure that are allowing applications that may be legacy in nature to reach consumers through the cloud, through mobile applications. And so that’s a very attractive part of the market that’s often not talked about with very good consistent, 20 type plus percent growth, good earnings, and so that’s an area we continue to find good names.</p><p>Courtney:  [00:32:31] So a lot of opportunity there.  How challenging is it to invest in technology with disruption it seems around every corner?</p><p>Mitch Begun:  [00:32:39] Well, that’s the fun part.  That’s our passion.  And there’s probably a lot of different views on that.  But as growth investors, that’s what we do.  And we are very much focused on looking at a lot of names, talking about a lot of names, because of the characteristics you just made.  And because you’re paying so much for the future growth of a company, by the time it’s more obvious the stocks are very expensive.  So we need to be looking at names early, talking about a lot of names and capturing that change, because the vast majority of that disruption and/or change in the stock prices happens quickly.  So that’s one of the ways we mitigate it and it’s also exciting, like talking about new small companies and it’s a lot of fun.</p><p>Courtney:  [00:33:24] Of course.  And good point though, that you have to be early in order to capture the value because you’re right, that’s very quick.  So let’s get into it with sectors, what do you like, Greg?</p><p>Gregory Halter:  [00:33:33] Again, we’re more company specific.  So if you look at our portfolios they’re awfully ad looking in terms of the sectors.  In fact we have no biotech, we have no energy, we have no utilities, we have no REITs.  And you’d say, “Wow, you guys must have been killed.”  But we actually had a pretty good year last year in the small cap land.  But again I think it comes down to looking for the best companies in these that we can find, no matter what the sector is.  Some company that may have a new product that’s selling at a value price that hasn’t been recognized by the market, and kind of like Mitch, we’re looking for companies that are secondary or tertiary plays of something.  So think of cell phones, you know, where is the Motorola phone these days?  I mean I don’t even know if they make it anymore.  But you can look behind the scenes there and see companies that are benefitting from the growth of data.  And there’s lots of data being used, we know that, it’s expanding at a rapid rate.  So there are companies that benefit from that.  So those are the types of things we look for.  We’re not, we’re totally sector agnostic, again trying to find the best companies that we can out there.</p><p>Bill Hench:  [00:34:41] So we own lots of tech, about 30% of our fund is tech.  And a lot of the names we own are not household names, most of them aren’t and most of them aren’t new technology but they’re component makers, chip makers, people supplying the people who ultimately give you the product.  And a lot of those names trade at low teens multiples, they have these wonderful balance sheets and they’re in markets that are much more diverse.  So when you look at tech now you’re not just relying on networking, it can be computers, but [inaudible] autos and industrial and medical and things of that nature, if the market’s going to work like we think it’s going to work in 16 and 17, you’ve got to see better numbers out of housing.  You had one yesterday and that doesn’t make us streak, but at least you had one, you know, all the demographic data’s been gone through a 100 times by everybody.  But you get over a million, a million two units a year, you combine that with what has been a very, very good, another area we’re invested in is non-residential construction.  And you should be in pretty good shape.  We’re light in things like healthcare, and healthcare had a great run but you know, any time you cure [inaudible] and things like that you should have a good run, right, okay.  But now, you know, a lot of the cyclical things look pretty good to us.  You’ve had a big, big pullback in the industrials because over the last decade a lot of the industrial names also had a little bit of business in what was called energy, now that’s all sort of disappeared, have been cut in half, those names have pulled back.  There’s always lots to buy.</p><p>Courtney:  [00:36:09] Lots to buy.  And you mentioned population; I think is a secular trend that’s fuelling a lot of the areas, the sectors you just mentioned, any other secular trends that are fuelling growth in the companies that you’re invested in?</p><p>Gregory Halter:  [00:36:21] You know, you’re still talking about solar and you see it everywhere, you don’t have to buy solar companies to get exposure, you see it in semiconductors, you see it in capital equipment, you see it in transport, you see it in new engines being developed.  So it’s a very, very broad market, similar to technology, can be found at a lot of different places.</p><p>Courtney:  [00:36:43] Okay, yeah.</p><p>Mitch Begun:  [00:36:43] And I’d add one other quick one is you’ve got the new channel of the Panama Canal coming on stream and there’s lots of goods that may have been going to the west coast, but would come to the east coast trying to find companies that would benefit from that secular trend.  I mean that could be huge for many, many years to come.</p><p>Courtney:  [00:36:58] Absolutely.  Sector wise, what are you seeing, Jack?</p><p>Jack McPherson:  [00:37:02] Well, like you mentioned before, I mean with the proliferation of broadband, I mean obviously with all the connected devices, whether they be consumer or whether they be enterprise, demand for broadband just continues to go up.  So you don’t necessarily need to own the broadband service providers, but the companies that help wire the nation if you will, so there are situations like that.  And I do think energy has obviously taken it on the chin here in the last six months or so.  But I think there’s still a longer term opportunity within the energy sector with the development of the shale reserves and companies, they can help on that, you know, does that mean going out and buying them today?  I’m not sure about that, but there’s clearly opportunities there.  So from a secular basis we try to stay focused on the company specific fundamentals as opposed to trying to identify a trend and then going and building a portfolio.  So you know, we look at these things but we really start with the company and try to factor in the risk associated, whether it’s a secular story or a cyclical story, and so you know, we’re finding opportunities across the board.  The only thing we really avoid is binary situations where if you’re right, you’re right.  But you’re wrong you’re going to get wiped out.</p><p>Courtney:  [00:38:15] Can you give an example of that?</p><p>Jack McPherson:  [00:38:17] Well, I mean biotechnology’s the best example.  But it can also be an energy company that has a, you know, one opportunity to discover oil or gas and if they’re unsuccessful, there’s no company behind it, it can be single product companies, it can be a variety of situations.  And so it really just comes down to that risk reward, and I think the idea is to keep an open mind, be sector agnostic, be industry agnostic, be business model agnostic and really try to identify good companies that can create shareholder value.  And if they have a tailwind of a secular story like broadband or like you know, any of the other number of secular opportunities out there, then that’s great.  But it needs to be able to stand on its own two feet first.</p><p>Courtney:  [00:38:59] Right.  So where would, for instance, E&amp;P be an example of something that’s not so binary or a different type of service provider within, you mentioned the energy revolution and [0:39:10.2].</p><p>Jack McPherson:  [00:39:11] Yeah, with the advent of the development of the shale reserves in the US, you know, when oil was a $100 a barrel, you know, a lot of these areas were economic, well, now that number’s been reset.  That changes … there’s still opportunities within the shale but it’s not as broad as it once was.  So I mean, you know, you need to focus on the right areas that are more economic at lower prices.  And which companies you’re going to help lower the cost development curve for the energy industry, you know, so years ago there was a lot of talk about peak oil.  Well, peak oil is dependent upon the price of the commodity.  And the technology that’s developed to help unlock the reserves that are in the ground.  So the point being is that I think there’s … even though oil may have reset down to a level which I’m not sure where it’s going to finally level out, there’s still going to be opportunity, you just need to be able to dig in, you know, do the homework as was mentioned earlier, and identify good companies.  And if you get upside because oil moves back to the $100 level that’s great, but you need to be able to make a case for it in the current environment and not depend on that to really drive your return.</p><p>Courtney:  [00:40:22] Interesting.  Okay.</p><p>Mitch Begun:  [00:40:26] Yeah.  I’d like to add something on oil I think and I agree with a lot of what he said.  I think from the short term perspective we have seen, I think, a very rational behavior to an oversupply environment whereby, you know, the number of rigs is down 50 some percent.  So we’re in this self-correcting mechanism which is healthy for the industry.  I do think over the long term there are headwinds.  And I’m skeptical that we will hit new highs in the intermediate period, largely because what’s happened is we’ve recognized that we do have this supply here.  And more importantly, that we’ve found good ways to extract it, such that should global demand improve you effectively will see more supply.  And so now there is a new ceiling in the price of oil.  And so our focus is very similar in that there are companies that can thrive in oil at $60/70 and can generate significant IRRs.  And so we’re excited about that.  And the final point I’d make on that is that the volatility in oil prices is probably actually a good thing.  It’s scary to watch and we can talk about it on TV.  But this is how industries shake out, and this is how winners and losers emerge.  And that’s as a stock, you know, a stock picker focused on that, that’s really exciting.  And so you know, I’m optimistic that we can find those companies and build a portfolio around them even with the fact that I’m concerned about long term oil prices.</p><p>Courtney:  [00:42:03] So will those companies, let’s say long term oil prices do go up, let’s say, you know, there’s a good scenario there, will have that have a positive impact on these companies that are currently not dependent on that or…</p><p>Mitch Begun:  [00:42:16] Well, net/net of course it would help, if there’s someone that’s generating a 50% IRR at $60 oil to the extent it’s 70, it’s obviously helpful.  My only point on that is to the extent oil goes from 70 to 80 to 90, you’re going to see a flood of supply and therefore you have a new ceiling.  And that’s just different, that’s not how it was 10 years ago.  And so that’s our general view on energy.</p><p>Courtney:  [00:42:39] Okay.  And, Greg, I want to talk about construction, how can construction really benefit from the secular trends that we’re seeing?</p><p>Gregory Halter:  [00:42:46] And when you say construction do you mean construction?</p><p>Courtney:  [00:42:50] For instance the rails, I think we talked earlier about.</p><p>Gregory Halter:  [00:42:54] Sure.  Talking about the Panama Canal or weaving that in, you know, not only will the rail traffic need to be expanded if you will on the east coast, but maybe the ports will have to be dredged, you know, things of that nature.  So from a construction standpoint, you know, we do own companies in that area that actually haven’t done very well recently.  But again we’re investing for the next three to five years.  And so if they’re in there getting those contracts where others aren’t or others have left the industry, then they should be the natural beneficiary of those types of trends.  But once that canal is … that channel is built and ready to go, so again you’ll need things like ports, you know, deeper channels, rail to take the goods inland, the trucking companies and so forth and so on.  And those are many industries where there’s actually shortages of workers and so that kind of creates a pricing dynamic as well that could be beneficial to those astute managements of those companies as long as they are astute.</p><p>Courtney:  [00:43:53] Right, absolutely.  And, Bill, what about you know, you mentioned the commodity complex being kind of depressed lately.  That is kind of a tailwind though for a lot of the companies who are producing goods and services.</p><p>Bill Hench:  [00:44:04] Right.  But maybe this is a consumer economy that we live in.  And are people in the oil patch are going to be affected dramatically?  You bet.  But the vast majority of this country is consumer orientated.  And that’s what drives the economy, input costs, you adjust for them.  You talk about oil and you’ve already factored in costs are down probably 30% in the oil patch now from extraction.  So you reset the bar and you start all over again.  But I think for our economy you’d much rather have commodity prices lower than what you’ve seen over the last, you know, 15/20 years with the boom in China, much, much better to have a consumer orientated economy with lower commodity prices than higher commodity prices, benefitting a few sleeves of the country, you know, five years ago you could have said, you know, you could put your right hand over the west coast or your left hand, which one is the right, left hand over the west coast and your right hand over the east coast and right in the middle you had this emerging market, right down from Texas to the Dakotas.  But that’s, you know, that’s not the case anymore.  Now you’ve got the left and the right hand.</p><p>Courtney:  [00:45:12] Yeah, covering 70%.</p><p>Bill Hench:  [00:45:13] Right.  So you’ve got construction, you talked about construction, it’s not just LA and New York, you know, you’re talking about Tennessee, Georgia, the Carolinas, Colorado, you know, you’re talking about federal and state governments now with record tax receipts as well as the federal government which isn’t good for taxpayers, but it’s really, really good for non-residential construction.  And those, as you said, are jobs, good jobs, high paying jobs, so.</p><p>Courtney:  [00:45:39] Okay, yeah.  Any other thoughts on sectors?  Okay, Bill, tell me about the broken opportunities … I’m sorry, Bill, tell me about the opportunities you’re seeing in broken IPOs.</p><p>Bill Hench:  [00:45:50] Sure.  So what typically happens with an IPO is that it comes out and things look wonderful, you’ve had three, four or five good years of growth, everything’s perfect, you’ve got a wonderful management team.  You have this beautiful deck that you look at, while the charts look up into the right, and sometimes what you discover is that growth isn’t always like this, sometimes you get a little dip, sometimes especially in our world, small cap you have big customer concentrations.  Or if you’re providing parts to auto makers or telecom makers or semiconductor people, one of your customers pulled back for a quarter, you could miss a quarter, okay.  It doesn’t mean you’re a bad company, it doesn’t mean you’re a bad management team.  It just means that there is no alternative to selling to company x because company x has 40% of the market.  So what typically happens is growth players or whoever it is that owns it, have their discipline, they’ll pull back, the stock will be left in a position where it’s not exactly good enough for the growth players.  And it’s too expensive for the value players; you’re left with this thing, right.  And this thing usually has what?  It usually has good business, it usually has a lot of cash because they just came public, and usually if they’re as good as they said they were when they did their roadshow and you had your chicken and you watched them at lunch, usually you’re talking about a 20% or plus growth, right.</p><p>And you see it over and over again, and I can’t give you the names because we’re still buying them.  But I’m buying a networking company right now for less than $6 that came public at 15, I’m buying another tech company that came public at 12, opened up at 14, I’m buying that for $4.  Are they going to have another good quarter next quarter?  No, and they’re probably going to have two more bum quarters after that.  But a year and half/two years down the road they get back to 20, 20% growth, you have a nice appreciation.  It’s one of the four types of things that we do in the portfolio.  And usually the ones that turn out to be the best.</p><p>Courtney:  [00:47:33] So since you’ve seen a lot of these, when you’re at the Rubber Chicken roadshow, are you thinking, you know what, I think this price is going to break?</p><p>Bill Hench:  [00:47:41] No.</p><p>Courtney:  [00:47:41] Can you anticipate it or no?</p><p>Bill Hench:  [00:47:42] No.  What you’re thinking is, my goodness, if I could I’d like to own as much of this as I could, you know, whether it’s, you know, a lot of the restaurant companies that have come public like you know they’re going to go up, okay.  And you know that they’re going to have a secondary six months later.  But you know, they’re subject to the same thing that everybody else is subject to, and more so with these companies that we look at because of their size, right.  It doesn’t take a lot to sort of change that trajectory.  So you’re looking and you get jealous first because you say, “I wish I could own this thing.”  But you know, when it does get … when it does miss a quarter or when … or, you know, we own a little advertising company – a digital advertising company that was a $12 IPO, it’s probably $4.50 now.  It went down, not because they missed their quarter but because the competitor said, “We feel things might be slowing a little bit.”  Okay, and if you can take advantage of it, if you have the stomach to know that, you know, just because this quarter was bad, you’re not going to good, right, it’s probably going to get worse before it gets better.  But there are opportunities, it’s not for everybody.  You talked about liquidity; the liquidity is usually very, very bad on these things.  You’ll get a couple of days of nice volume as everybody exits.  But then you own it.</p><p>Courtney:  [00:48:56] Then you own it, okay.  But that’s a good case if you want it?</p><p>Bill Hench:  [00:48:59] Yes.</p><p>Courtney:  [00:48:59] Okay.</p><p>Jack McPherson:  [00:49:01] Well, I think, you know, that’s one of the exciting things about small cap is that there’s always new opportunities to look at.  And you don’t have to participate in the high IPOs.  Well, you’re probably not going to get much of an allocation anyways.  So you know, I wouldn’t describe it as a strategy of ours but it’s not something that you look at, because you’re always looking for things that are being, you know, we describe as being beaten up for the wrong reason, and maybe it’s for a short term, you know, legitimate reason, but does it change the long term outlook?  You know, if you do your homework and you identify that it’s not then that’s a great investment opportunity.  So rather than be frustrated you say, “This is great, you know, there’s lots of opportunity out there.”  And so when people debate about the levels in the market and where we’re going, they say, “Well, again, I’m not sure if I can call the direction of the market overall.  What I do know is that there are opportunities out there to identify individual companies, maybe they are broken IPOs, maybe they’re lowland companies that have stubbed their toe or maybe they’re companies that have just been … had a slow, you know, turnaround.”  And again that’s what makes the small cap market very exciting, it’s just very dynamic.</p><p>Courtney:  [00:50:00] Very dynamic, absolutely.  And with this cycle that we’re, you know, looking forward to, looking ahead, do you think this is a point in the market that will favor the activist investor with small caps?</p><p>Jack McPherson:  [00:50:10] Well, active manager, activist?</p><p>Courtney:  [00:50:13] I’m sorry, activist.</p><p>Jack McPherson:  [00:50:15] Activist will create more opportunities, but active management I think, you know, we are setting up for a pretty nice environment, again it’s been a challenging market for the last few years for active management because for a lot of the reasons we’ve talked about, with the, you know, the high correlations among the individual securities, with the real focus on some of these higher risk areas or higher beta areas.  And as we said before, coming off of that low in 2009, through currently with markets been compounded at 15, 16, 17% a year, that’s unlikely to be repeated.  It doesn’t mean you have to call for a bear market, you just say, “If we stop going up at the rate we were going up before.”  The market broadens out a little bit, and you get a rotation of what’s driving the market, I think it makes it … it creates a favorable backdrop for active management.  And the key to active management for us is being long term oriented and staying focused on, is the company creating value?  And we don’t necessarily care if the market’s not rewarding you for it right now, but you know, if you create value and you pay the right price the market will eventually catch up to you.  So I think that’s the kind of world that we’ll … again it’s never easy, everybody here knows it doesn’t mean that it’s easy, but active management becomes, you know, just becomes more in favor, if you will.</p><p>Courtney: [00:51:35] Absolutely, that makes sense.</p><p>Mitch Begun:  [00:51:37] I love hearing these guys because it shows we all take different approaches.  And yet active management in small caps, I think we all believe strongly and there’s clearly inefficiencies.  And you know, it’s by broken IPOs, our team might throw up, they even have a discussion.  But we have had great success in looking at IPOs.  And our philosophy is companies that are coming public and are well backed and have high growth rates, those are the companies that have a potential to be very large over time.  And so my philosophy is, let’s review every single one of them, not necessarily a buy right then, a lot of times these stocks pull back, you’ve got lockups, you’ve got liquidity improvements.  But we need to understand them.  And we’ve done very well finding names that way, and looking at really these new companies that are changing things, so it’s exciting.</p><p>Courtney:  [00:52:29] Yeah.  That’s a great point that you made, and that is the common thread, active management particularly lends itself I think in small cap investing.</p><p>Mitch Begun:  [00:52:35] Absolutely.</p><p>Courtney:  [00:52:36] And very quickly I want to just bring up one last chart.  It compares the Russell 2000 versus the S&amp;P 600 growth.  I just think this is really interesting that the 600 has outperformed over the past 14 years or so, it’s outperformed the Russell, why do you think that is?</p><p>Mitch Begun:  [00:52:54] Yeah.  Yeah, I think it’s … I think they’re both great indices.  I think they bring different things.  They bring different factors.  I’ve read a paper on this specifically.  And what you see in S&amp;P 600 in the way it’s constituted is that they have requirements for profitability.  So I think a company has to have over the last 12 months be profitable, including the last quarter.  So the nature of the company that’s going into the S&amp;P 600 tends to be more stable, so that’s a predictor of better returns, number one.  And then number two, the other large contributing factor is the fact that the Russell 2000 reconstitutes every year in June.  And so by definition, and when you look at the return profile, July is often the biggest spread between these two indices is that the Russell 2000, the winners are being sold and they’re buying stuff from the 1000 that are coming down.  So in effect you have a negative [inaudible] portfolio, and in a very short period of time that’s a very bad predictor of performance.  And over time this is the results of that, I do think they’re both great indices from an absolute return perspective, they offer different things, they have different style tilts and to each his own.  The 2000 obviously has more opportunities across a number of names and different characteristics.  And the S&amp;P 600 maybe has arguably a higher quality bias and that’s helped over a time period and that’s my interpretation of it.  I know there are some other factors as well.</p><p>Jack McPherson:  [00:54:26] And I think what it does is it points to the importance of profitability.  I mean unprofitable companies can go up in the short term but they can’t go up forever.  It’s just mathematically impossible.  So the fact that the S&amp;P 600 has that profit requirement speaks to the benefits of really being a good long term fundamental investor where companies can grow their profits and create value for shareholders.  So you know you’ll have period of time where it reverses where unprofitable companies do well but it’s just not sustainable.  You either have to turn a profit or you’re going to out of business.</p><p>Courtney:  [00:55:02] Right.  Right.  Well, it’s interesting though to both of your points, the 600, you know, it’s looking for companies that have that profitability, so very interesting.  And this has been such an interesting class on small caps, I just want to go to final takeaways and I’d like to start with you, Greg, what are your final takeaways on small cap investing right now?</p><p>Gregory Halter:  [00:55:20] Well, I wouldn’t be sitting here if I didn’t believe in small cap investing.  I do think that there are opportunities in the small cap area just because these companies are more dynamic.  They don’t have 16 levels of management like the large companies do.  I think that lots of times they have real businesses that can turn on a dime and be able to adjust to their environment.  And I think that’s important that those companies have real businesses and again, hopefully reflect it in their margins and then the stock prices performance over time.  As long as the … you can have a great business in a small cap area but if the management doesn’t understand how to allocate capital properly or they horde cash or whatever the case may be, not rewarding shareholders with dividends or share repurchase or you know, smarter decisions on capital spending, then you really don’t have much there.  So again I think the small cap area as Mitch said is very dynamic, it’s very exciting.  There’s lots going on there and it’s a very attractive area to invest in.</p><p>Courtney:  [00:56:26] And understanding the management team as mission critical?</p><p>Gregory Halter:  [00:56:29] Yes, we place a lot of weight in understanding managements.</p><p>Courtney:  [00:56:32] Bill, your final takeaways.</p><p>Bill Hench:  [00:56:33] So, I obviously agree, it’s a great place to invest, you have to be comfortable with the fact that liquidity is not good.  Financing is more difficult for our companies and probably the biggest difference between investing in smaller companies than bigger companies is that you know the management depth.  They have good managements but it’s not a situation what you have with the big companies where you have, you know, big recruiting efforts, people come out of college, they get trained, they get brought through the system, they learn the culture.  With our companies [inaudible] a head of sales, a head of research, a CFO, it could really set things back in the short term, so as long as you’re compensated for the risks, it’s a great place to invest.</p><p>Courtney:  [00:57:13] Compensated for the risk, and with returns you are, so, your final takeaways, Jack.</p><p>Jack McPherson:  [00:57:18] Well, you know, you’re obviously biased like everybody here but I think it is a great asset class.  I think because of the inefficiency, whether it be from a trading liquidity perspective, whether it be from a Wall Street coverage perspective, whether it be from an access to management perspective, I think there’s opportunity to identify underappreciated companies.  And there’s an opportunity to generate excess alpha relative to the benchmark.  And that’s what gets you excited every day is that there’s a real chance you can go and identify that new undiscovered company that’s going to go up dramatically over the course of a, you know, three, four, five, six, seven years or longer.  And so you know, cycles will come, cycles will go, investor enthusiasm for small cap will ebb and flow.  But I think the long term data will … proves out that this is an area that you can generate above average returns as an asset class.  And it’s an area where skilled active managers can add alpha above and beyond that.  So that’s what gets us up every day is, is to try to do that.</p><p>Courtney:  [00:58:16] Absolutely, and investors are always looking for alpha so, takeaways.</p><p>Mitch Begun:  [00:58:20] Yeah.  You stole my thunder.  It’s a tremendous asset class, you know, on a risk adjusted basis.  There are risks inherent that we’ve talked about.  But from an absolute return perspective I think every investor should be looking at it, and probably more importantly, due to the inefficiencies, due to the lack of coverage on Wall Street, there is still very significant opportunity for active management in small caps.  And that’s not necessarily true as you move up cap.  And so that’s what’s exciting about it and why we get up every day.</p><p>Courtney:  [00:58:57] Absolutely.  Alright, so active management, alpha, all good things.  Thank you so much, gentlemen.
